# Homework Planner

This app is a **Homework Planner** I created to teach myself some Dart/Flutter development, which may come in handy in the future. Features include:

* adding homework
* marking homework as done
* notifications the day before the homework is due
* helpful and decent-looking display of subject, title, description and teacher for each homework upon selection
* ability to take photos within the app and save them as part of the homework
* ability to view said photos from within the app

If I feel adventurous, I may add the following:
* file attachments for worksheets
* sorting homework by date due and subject
